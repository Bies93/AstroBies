# Rendering System Migration Plan: Canvas 2D vs PIXI.js

## Current State

The current rendering system uses Canvas 2D API with:
- Immediate mode rendering (draw calls every frame)
- Manual drawing of all game objects (player, enemies, bullets, particles)
- Procedural visual effects (glow, blur, shadows)
- Direct context manipulation with shadow effects

## Migration Options

### Option A: Enhanced Canvas 2D (Retained)
**Pros:**
- Familiar to current implementation
- Good performance for current game style
- Lower learning curve
- Smaller bundle size
- Maintains current visual style

**Cons:**
- Manual batching required for performance
- Limited built-in effects
- More manual optimization needed

### Option B: PIXI.js (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Built-in batching and performance optimizations
- Rich effects system (filters, blend modes)
- Spritesheet support for efficient asset loading
- Particle containers for better performance
- Modern GPU acceleration
- Built-in texture management

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for new API
- Larger bundle size
- Different rendering paradigm

## Recommended: PIXI.js Implementation

### 1. Core Renderer Class
```typescript
// src/core/renderer.ts
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';

export class Renderer {
  private app: PIXI.Application;
  private stage: PIXI.Container;
  private renderer: PIXI.Renderer;
  
  constructor(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {
    this.app = new PIXI.Application({
      view: canvas,
      backgroundColor: 0x0a0a0f,
      autoDensity: true,
      antialias: true,
      resolution: window.devicePixelRatio || 1,
    });
    
    this.stage = this.app.stage;
    this.renderer = this.app.renderer;
  }
  
  public render(): void {
    // PIXI handles rendering automatically
  }
  
  public resize(width: number, height: number): void {
    this.app.renderer.resize(width, height);
  }
}
```

### 2. PIXI.js Asset Management
- Implement spritesheet system for efficient texture loading
- Use TexturePacker for optimal sprite packing
- Implement texture caching and preloading

### 3. Particle System with PIXI
- Use ParticleContainer for high-performance particle rendering
- Implement custom particle effects for trails, explosions
- Leverage PIXI's built-in filters for glow effects

### 4. Visual Effects Migration
Current Canvas effects to PIXI equivalents:
- Shadow blur → Glow filters
- Gradient fills → Custom shaders or sprite textures
- Trail effects → Particle systems
- Screen shake → Stage positioning

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Install and configure PIXI.js
- [ ] Create basic renderer with PIXI application
- [ ] Set up asset loading pipeline

### Phase 2: Basic Objects
- [ ] Convert player rendering to PIXI sprites
- [ ] Convert enemy rendering to PIXI graphics/sprites
- [ ] Implement bullet rendering with PIXI

### Phase 3: Effects
- [ ] Implement particle systems for trails/explosions
- [ ] Add glow filters for visual effects
- [ ] Convert current visual effects to PIXI equivalents

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Implement object pooling with PIXI objects
- [ ] Add texture atlas support
- [ ] Optimize rendering with ParticleContainer

## Performance Considerations

1. **Batching**: Use ParticleContainer for similar objects
2. **Texture Management**: Efficient spritesheets and caching
3. **Object Pooling**: Reuse PIXI objects to minimize GC
4. **Filter Optimization**: Limit expensive filters to essential effects

## Visual Fidelity Preservation

- Maintain current neon/cyberpunk aesthetic
- Preserve glow and lighting effects using PIXI filters
- Keep smooth animations and transitions
- Maintain 60fps performance target
